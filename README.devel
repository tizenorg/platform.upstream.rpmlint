The latest development version can be retrieved from anonymous Subversion:

$ svn checkout http://rpmlint.zarb.org/svn/trunk/

To run rpmlint from the working tree or in place from an unpacked tarball:

$ ./rpmlint -C . <rpms>

...and to run only a single check, for example to test only FHSCheck:

$ ./rpmlint -C . -c FHSCheck <rpms>

For profiling, use something like:

$ python -O -u -m cProfile -s cumulative rpmlint -C . [...]
